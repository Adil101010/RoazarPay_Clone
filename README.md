# Razorpay Clone

A clone of the Razorpay website built using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind.

## Features

* Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices
* Customizable layout using Tailwind's utility classes
* Simple and clean design inspired by the original Razorpay website

## Getting Started

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Code Structure

The project consists of the following files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website
* `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the website, built using Tailwind
* `tailwind.config.js`: The configuration file for Tailwind

## Customization

To customize the website, you can modify the `styles.css` file to change the layout, colors, and other styles. You can also add new pages or components by creating new HTML files and linking them to the `index.html` file.

## Credits

The website design and content is based on the official Razorpay website (https://razorpay.com/), with some modifications to fit the scope of this project. The Tailwind CSS framework is used for styling and layout.
